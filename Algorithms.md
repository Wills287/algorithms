### Big-O complexity
| Big-O    | Complexity   |
|----------|--------------|
| O(1)     | Constant     |
| O(logn)  | Logarithmic  |
| O(n)     | Linear       |
| O(nlogn) | n log-star n |
| O(nÂ²)    | Quadratic    |

### In-place vs Out-of-place
In-place algorithms transform the input without using extra memory. The amount of memory required should be constant and not dependent upon the input size.

Out-of-place algorithms use additional memory based on the input size.

### Stable vs Unstable
Stable algorithms preserve the relative order of equal elements.

Unstable algorithms do not.
